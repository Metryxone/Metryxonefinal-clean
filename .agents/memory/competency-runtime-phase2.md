# Competency Runtime — Phase 2

Flag `competencyRuntime` (default OFF → 503 before any DB/auth). Engine in
`services/competency-runtime.ts`, routes in `routes/competency-runtime.ts`,
tables `onto_assessment_instances/responses/competency_scores/competency_profiles`
(profile append-only).

## Phase 2.4 Competency Scoring Engine — shares Phase 2.3's substrate
`services/competency-scoring.ts` (version `phase-2.4`) depends on the EXACT same substrate as Phase 2.3 assembly: `onto_question_competency_mapping`, `competency_question_templates.status='approved'`, and the `competencyRuntime` flag (env `FF_COMPETENCY_RUNTIME`). Once 2.3 was activated, 2.4 needed ZERO new fixes.
Chain: deriveRawScore (Q→raw; correct→100/0, or Likert ladder) → computeCompetencyScores (difficulty-weighted sum, ordinal foundational=1..expert=5) → normalizeScore (weighted %, or cohort T-score ONLY when real cohort n≥30, never fabricated) → calculateCompetencyLevel (≥80/60/40/20 → L5..L2 else L1; null→unmeasurable, never floored to 1). Empty/unscoreable responses → status `scoring_empty` + null overall. Persists to `onto_competency_score_runs`; reads level labels from `onto_proficiency_levels` (5 rows). Routes: POST /score, POST /score-preview (run_id null = not persisted), GET /score-runs/:runId.

## Domain-proxy measurement (the honesty crux)
- Question bank `competency_question_templates` is keyed by **7 codes**
  (COG/COM/LEA/EXE/ADP/TEC/EIQ); the genome taxonomy has **5 onto-domains**.
  `onto_competency_question_map` is **0 rows**, so a competency cannot be scored
  by its own questions yet.
- Curated inert `DOMAIN_CODE_TO_ONTO` crosswalk maps the 7 codes DOWN to the 5
  onto-domains; a competency inherits its **onto-domain** score →
  `measurement: "domain_proxy"`. **Auto-upgrades** to per-competency precision the
  moment `onto_competency_question_map` is populated — no code change.
- `dom_strategic` has **no bank code** → its competencies are reported
  `unmeasurable` (reason string), excluded from scores and coverage numerator.
  **Never** fabricate a score for them.
- Coverage (measurable vs total) is a SEPARATE axis from score. Bank empty (0
  approved templates) → generation honestly yields 0 questions.

## Scoring deviation
Mirrors bank `option.score` (0–100), NOT the CAF/IRT engine (wrong data shape).
`scoreToLevel`: ≥80→5, ≥60→4, ≥40→3, ≥20→2, else 1. Likert/no-option questions
default to a 5-point 0/25/50/75/100 scale (see competency-questions.ts rowToQuestion).

## Access control
`subject_id` is an OPERATOR-supplied identifier for any assessed person (not the
caller's own identity). All five routes are `gate → requireAuth → requireSuperAdmin`.
A `requireAuth`-only version is an IDOR (any user reads/scores any subject) — a code
review caught exactly this. Reuses `getRoleReadiness` for gap analysis.

## Phase 2.5 Profile Engine + Phase 2.6 Role Readiness
- TWO DISTINCT scoring paths feed the chain — do not confuse:
  1. **Phase 2 generate→score** (7-letter codes COG/COM/LEA/EXE/ADP/TEC/EIQ,
     `question_type='likert'`) writes `onto_competency_profiles`. This is what 2.5/2.6
     READ.
  2. **Phase 2.3/2.4 assemble→/score** (comp_* ids) writes `onto_competency_score_runs`
     (the existing panel Steps 1–3). Separate substrate.
- `computeTypeProfile()` buckets each blueprint competency into 5 onto-TYPES
  (behavioral/cognitive/functional/technical/future_skills) via `onto_competency_type_map`;
  UNCLASSIFIED when the map has no row (never fabricate). Buckets carry score/level/count;
  `classification_coverage_pct` is a separate axis from score.
- `computeRoleReadinessForSubject` → `getRoleReadiness` returns `null` ONLY when no
  role profile exists (honest "unmeasured"). Do NOT wrap it in `.catch(()=>null)` — that
  masks real DB errors as business-state absence; let them propagate to a 500.
- `roleFit()` adds `strengths` (attainment ≥100% met-or-exceeded), `gap_areas`,
  `critical_gaps`, and a `role_fit` band to readiness output.
- Seeded demo: `onto_role_competency_profiles` blueprint_derived rows;
  `onto_competency_type_map` via competency-types seed (confidence 'high' + evidence,
  needs_review). Demo Likert bank `template_key LIKE 'demo7_<CODE>_<n>'`.

## Flag-gated admin tab (frontend hide when OFF)
Tab `competency-runtime` in `useAdminDashboardState.tsx` is gated by probing a gated GET
(`/api/competency-runtime/competency-types/report` → `res.ok`) into `competencyRuntimeEnabled`,
then a `.map` that filters the nav item out when false (mirrors simHarness/governance pattern).
Flag OFF → routes 503 + tab hidden = byte-identical to legacy.

## Testing
No UI/HTTP-ON path in dev (workflow leaves flag OFF). Exercise the engine via a
tsx script that sets `process.env.FF_COMPETENCY_RUNTIME='1'`, seeds demo `approved`
templates (`template_key LIKE 'demo_phase2_%'`) against `blueprint_pm`, runs the
chain, then DELETEs every demo row (shared dev/prod DB → must be purgeable).

## Phase 2.7 — Competency Gap Analysis (additive over computeGapAnalysis)
- `prioritizeGap(GapRow)` is PURE: matrix critical&gap>0→high(0); important gap≥2→high(1)
  else medium(10); desirable gap≥2→medium(11) else low(20); optional gap≥1→low(21);
  gap≤0→none(80); unmeasurable/unscored→unprioritized(90). Sort rank,gap,weight.
  unmeasurable/unscored NEVER get a fabricated priority — that IS the honesty contract.
- `computeCompetencyGapEngine()` COMPOSES `computeGapAnalysis()` (never recomputes gaps),
  reshapes each row to canon Required/Current/Gap/Priority/Development Need via
  `developmentNeed()` deterministic templates (raise / maintain / cannot-be-measured /
  not-scored). `computeGapDashboard()` = engine + readiness + coverage rollup.
- Routes `GET /api/competency-runtime/gap-engine/:subjectId` + `/gap-dashboard/:subjectId`,
  `gate, requireAuth, requireSuperAdmin` (gate FIRST = byte-identical OFF). Responses wrap
  under `.data` ({ok,version,data:{...}}).
- Frontend: gap table (Required/Current/Gap/Priority/Development Need) + priority-summary
  badges in `CompetencyRuntimePanel.tsx`, fetched alongside dashboard in `loadDashboard`
  (Promise.all); gapEngine null-tolerant so a 503 just hides the table.
- Demo subject `demo_subj_pm` meets/exceeds all reqs → all 'none'/'unprioritized', 0 dev
  needs. That's the HONEST output, not a bug (no High/Med/Low fires without a real gap).
