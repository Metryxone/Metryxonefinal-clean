Every canonical persona growth path → the EXISTING implementations it REUSES (verified vs live FS+DB).

## Canonical growth spine (FROZEN, 15 steps)
1. **Assessment** (`assessment`) — A scored behavioural / competency assessment establishes the working signal.  _(reuses: capadex_sessions + scoring (routes/capadex.ts))_
2. **Evidence Collection** (`evidence_collection`) — Evidence accrues into the longitudinal record (one datapoint per progression).  _(reuses: services/wc3/longitudinal-foundation.ts → wc3_longitudinal_snapshots)_
3. **AI Interpretation** (`ai_interpretation`) — AI interprets signals/competencies into an explainable diagnosis.  _(reuses: services/pil/runtime-guidance-engine.ts + behavioural-signal)_
4. **Recommendation Generation** (`recommendation`) — Next-best-action / growth recommendations are generated.  _(reuses: services/recommendation-intelligence-engine.ts + career/lbi/mei recommendation engines)_
5. **Learning Plan** (`learning_plan`) — A personalised learning / development plan is composed.  _(reuses: services/learning-path-engine.ts)_
6. **Practice Activity** (`practice_activity`) — Practice / activities are surfaced for the learner to act on.  _(reuses: recommendation + intervention catalogs (services/pil/recommendation-catalog.ts))_
7. **Behaviour Reinforcement** (`behaviour_reinforcement`) — Behavioural reinforcement nudges the learner toward the target pattern.  _(reuses: services/intervention-intelligence.ts (reinforcement-class interventions))_
8. **Competency Development** (`competency_development`) — Competency / EI development is tracked against the genome.  _(reuses: services/mei-scoring-engine.ts + development_recommendations)_
9. **Personalized Intervention** (`personalized_intervention`) — A targeted intervention is delivered for the diagnosed gap.  _(reuses: services/intervention-intelligence.ts → capadex_interventions / lbi_intervention_library)_
10. **Progress Measurement** (`progress_measurement`) — Progress is measured as a longitudinal trend vs the baseline.  _(reuses: services/longitudinal-memory.ts + longitudinal_patterns)_
11. **Reassessment** (`reassessment`) — Interval / exit re-administration of the existing assessment (close-the-loop).  _(reuses: services/capadex/progression-outcome-capture.ts (getReassessmentSignal) + wc7b/longitudinal-automation.ts)_
12. **Improvement Validation** (`improvement_validation`) — Improvement is validated against the prior datapoint(s).  _(reuses: services/longitudinal-memory.ts (trend) + career_readiness_history)_
13. **Outcome Achievement** (`outcome_achievement`) — A realized outcome is captured into the canonical ledger.  _(reuses: services/outcome-intelligence-engine.ts → validation_loop_outcomes)_
14. **Promotion** (`promotion`) — The subject is promoted along the lifecycle (Curiosity→Insight→Growth→Mastery).  _(reuses: lib/lifecycle.ts + services/capadex/evidence-gate.ts → wc3_stage_progression)_
15. **Continuous Development** (`continuous_development`) — The loop re-enters: the next growth cycle begins from the new baseline.  _(reuses: services/wc7b/longitudinal-automation.ts (reassessment cadence) — adoption-gated)_

## Loop-closure invariants (4)
- **INV1-RECOMMEND-TO-ACTION** — Recommendation → Learning / Practice / Intervention (the growth action is generated): `recommendation` → `personalized_intervention` via Recommendation engines feed the learning-path + intervention catalogs, so every diagnosis yields a concrete next action. COMPOSED by reference, never invoked.
- **INV2-INTERVENTION-TO-REASSESS** — Intervention → Reassessment (the action is followed by a re-measurement): `personalized_intervention` → `reassessment` via After an intervention, the reassessment signal (getReassessmentSignal) surfaces interval/exit re-administration eligibility from the accrued longitudinal record. MECHANISM present (Phase 1.3 reuse); gated by longitudinalOutcomeCapture.
- **INV3-REASSESS-TO-IMPROVEMENT** — Reassessment → Improvement validation (the re-measurement is compared to the baseline): `reassessment` → `improvement_validation` via A second datapoint lets the longitudinal trend validate improvement vs the prior baseline. MECHANISM present; effectiveness/accuracy stays abstained (no decision-time prediction recorded) until real volume accrues — honest-null, never fabricated.
- **INV4-IMPROVEMENT-TO-PROMOTION** — Improvement → Promotion / Outcome (validated growth advances the lifecycle stage): `improvement_validation` → `promotion` via Validated readiness drives stage promotion (evidence-gate readiness band) and a realized-outcome capture into the canonical ledger. MECHANISM present (evidence-gate + progression-outcome-capture); promotion is readiness-DERIVED, not a uniformly enforced per-persona gate (see GAP-P1).

## Lifecycle promotion rules (4)
- **CAP_CUR Curiosity** (SUPPORTED) — Curiosity→Insight when a baseline + diagnosis exist (readiness band derived by evidence-gate; promotion recorded in wc3_stage_progression).
- **CAP_INS Insight** (SUPPORTED) — Insight→Growth when a growth plan is generated and the subject begins acting (recommendation→action link, INV1).
- **CAP_GRW Growth** (PARTIAL) — Growth→Mastery when reassessment validates sustained improvement (readiness band high) — readiness-DERIVED (GAP-P1: not a uniformly enforced per-persona gate).
- **CAP_MAS Mastery** (PARTIAL) — Mastery is terminal in the coded ladder; the loop re-enters via continuous-development (reassessment cadence) — adoption-gated.

## Progression decisions (not silent merges)
- **Single progression engine (no V2)** → `COMPOSE_EXISTING` — The continuous-growth loop is realised by EXISTING engines (progression-outcome-capture, evidence-gate, recommendation/learning/intervention/longitudinal). This phase adds ONE read-only composer/registry, never a parallel progression engine.
- **Promotion gate** → `READINESS_DERIVED` — Promotion is derived from evidence-gate readiness bands recorded in wc3_stage_progression, NOT a new hard gate. A uniformly enforced per-persona promotion gate is GAP-P1 (Medium) — additive/optional, never fabricated as done.
- **Reassessment cadence** → `ON_READ_SIGNAL` — getReassessmentSignal derives eligibility on read (no scheduler). Automated cadence (wc7b/longitudinal-automation) is adoption-gated. Continuous growth is a MECHANISM (Coverage) whose ADOPTION is usage-driven (null≠0).
